## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. You can get your account set up by contacting us at [success@apexscore.ai](mailto:success@apexscore.ai).

Once you have an account with Apex, you can use your credentials (email and password) to explore the [Log In](/api-reference/authentication/log-in) endpoint to retrieve your token.
