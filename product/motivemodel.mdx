## Introduction

**MotiveModels** are the foundational building blocks of Apex and your motivational lens through which we conduct all our analyses across our products. 

**MotiveModels** deliver a custom profile of customer motivation for a specific audience so you can influence behavior in a way only your brand can. It identifies the underlying drivers of customer advocacy and purchase decisions and prescribes actions and interventions to influence them.

They are a starting point for deeper, more custom prescriptive intelligence from [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath) and are optimized and tracked over time with [**MotiveLoop**](/product/motiveloop).

**MotiveModels** can be built for segments, competitors, and holistic industries and are ready to be applied to your strategies out of the box.

## How it works

1. **Select your audience**  
   Choose a segment, customer type, or even a competitor audience you want to understand more deeply.

2. **Measure Motivations**
   Collaborate with us to design a short survey instrument built around our 16 motivational drivers, customized to your category or customer journey. Learn more about our [measurement techniques](/motivations/measurement).

   Our options collect data to strategically streamline the process are:
   * We can purchase data from one of our trusted panel providers
   * We can program and field this survey to your audience through our tools or your existing infrastructure
   * We can [synthesize data](/methodology/synthetic_data) from industry data in certain cases

   We offer optional full turn-key management of this effort.

3. **(Optional) Integrate your other data**  
   Enrich findings by layering in behavioral, demographic, transactional, or geographic data for deeper segmentation.

4. **Model and analyze**  
    We apply machine learning to uncover which motivations are most predictive of real-world behaviors. You get ranked motivators and insight by segment. What-to-do-next recommendations are driven by the open-ended feedback topics we uncover in the data and statistically mapped back to their motivator relevance.

    Receive and explore your results via [platform](/product/platform) access ([**MotiveLoop**](/product/motiveloop) only), expert report, or executive presentation, ready to apply across marketing, product, CX, and operations.

## What it delivers

- A ranked list of the motivational drivers most predictive of advocacy and purchase loyalty
- Segment-level insight on what customer groups need to feel in order to act
- Strategic recommendations across touchpoints like messaging, journey design, or product. 
- Expert analysis and presentations for executive alignment

<Note>
As part of an annualized [**MotiveLoop**](/product/motiveloop) engagement with us, your **MotiveModels** are also explorable in your private [Apex web platform](/product/platform) instance.

## Who it's for

- **Strategy leaders** who need insight into what actually moves customer behavior, not just what they clicked on
- **CX, CRM, and loyalty teams** aiming for sharper personalization and more emotionally resonant experiences
- **Researchers and analysts** looking to add a psychological layer to their existing models
- **Product teams** building features and flows aligned with what people value most

## Why it matters

Most companies know *what* their customers do but not *why* they do it. That leads to scattershot tactics, margin-eating incentives, and low-ROI campaigns. **MotiveModel** corrects this by anchoring your strategies in what people care about most.

When you understand that one group is driven by <Motivator name="dependable" /> and <Motivator name="authentic" />, while another is motivated by <Motivator name="joyful" /> and <Motivator name="relatable" />, you can:

- Build more relevant campaigns
- Design more compelling experiences
- Influence behavior with confidence and precision
- And much, much more...

## Example Deliverable

MotiveModels are delivered either in a platform instance (with [**MotiveLoop**](/product/motiveloop)) or as a standlone report and/or presentation. See the [web platform](/product/platform) for an example of MotiveModel results. Our analysts will tease out hidden insights from the data and decorate them with tailored narratives.

## Next step: Apply with MotivePath

**MotiveModel** lays the foundation for advocacy and purchase loyalty. When we are solving for other targets such as reducing churn or increasing engagement, we use [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath) to simulate, prioritize, and execute the most effective interventions that leverage the top motivators.
