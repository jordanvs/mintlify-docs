## What is MotiveLoop?

**MotiveLoop** offers an embedded intelligence layer that continuously measures performance and motivational changes, learns from behavior, and optimizes your strategies toward desired business outcomes with expert support along the way.

It combines the insight of [**MotiveModel**](/product/motivemodel), the actionability of [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath), and the adaptability of ongoing learning into a single, strategic system. As your customers evolve, **MotiveLoop** ensures your strategies do too.

## How it works

1. **Establish the foundation**  
   Start with your initial [**MotiveModel**](/product/motivemodel) to create a motivational baseline for key customer segments.

2. **Connect and share data**  
   Set up automated or recurring data flows to monitor behavioral shifts, KPIs, and research inputs.

3. **Refresh, learn, and adapt**  
   Apex regularly re-trains your [**MotiveModels**](/product/motivemodel) using survey data, synthetic data (so we don't tire out your audience), and behavioral feedback to refine predictions.

4. **Deliver new prescriptions**  
   As new challenges or opportunities emerge, we run updated [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath) simulations and generate fresh action plans.

5. **Close the loop with measurement**  
   Track ROI and KPIs tied to past actions, feeding results back into the system to guide future priorities.

<Note>
With MotiveLoop, a dedicated Apex analyst team and continuous data flows enable the fastest time to value for new [**MotiveModels**](/product/motivemodel) and [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath) assignments as you navigate your fiscal year.
