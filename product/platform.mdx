## What is the Apex Platform?

The **Apex Platform** is your control center and reference point for motivational intelligence. It provides on-demand access to the insights, models, and action plans developed through [**MotiveModel**](/product/motivemodel), [**MotivePath**](/product/motivepath), and [**MotiveLoop**](/product/motiveloop) so your team can explore, filter, and apply motivational data whenever needed.
