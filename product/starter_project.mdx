## The Goal

A short, high-impact engagement delivered in report-style showing you what’s possible when motivational intelligence is added to your existing data, and leave with insights you can use immediately, and gain a clear view of how this can scale across your business.

## What You Get

<Steps>
  <Step title="Top Motivations Driving Your Customers">
    Discover the three most influential motivational drivers that predict your most important outcomes (such as purchase, day-part, loyalty, retention, cross-sell, etc.).  

    <Info>**Example:** A B2B software provider might find that *Predictable*, *Responsive*, and *Meaningful* are the top three motivations driving renewals. A healthcare provider might see *Dependable*, *Respectful*, and *Empathetic* as the strongest drivers of patient retention.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implications of those Motivators to Your Business">
    Understand the business implications of these key motivators and how they impact your strategy, campaign designs, segment definitions, etc.  

    <Info>**Example:** If *Authentic* emerges as a top motivator, a consumer goods company may need to highlight sourcing transparency and ethical practices in marketing. If *Affordable* is critical, a financial services firm might create tiered pricing to match customer expectations.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Why People Act and Why They Don’t">
    Gain clarity on the underlying human factors influencing engagement, purchase, and advocacy.  

    <Info>**Example:** An online retailer may discover customers aren’t engaging because *Responsive* service expectations aren’t met, even though the product quality is high. A logistics firm might find that consistent on-time delivery (*Dependable*) is the deciding factor for contract renewals.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action Plan">
    Focus all our data combined with open-ended customer feedback for specific, prioritized recommendations to influence behavior and achieve your chosen outcome.

    <Info>**Example:** A travel brand could focus first on improving loyalty program communication for *Joyful* experiences, then follow with a marketing campaign that reinforces *Meaningful* travel moments to drive repeat bookings.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Predictive Simulations">
    Explore ROI-modeled scenarios showing the likely impact of taking the recommended actions.  

    <Info>**Example:** A telco might model the revenue lift from improving *Responsive* customer support. A manufacturer could simulate the increased order frequency if *Principled* sourcing is highlighted in product marketing.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Opportunity Segments">
    Identify the customer groups most worth targeting and how to best influence them.

    <Info>**Example:** A QSR chain might see that *Relatable* and *Affordable* drive lunch traffic among students. A SaaS company might target *Forward-Thinking* mid-market firms most likely to adopt new features early.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="(Optional) Competitive Insights">
    See how your motivational profiles compare to competitors or category benchmarks.  

    <Info>**Example:** A hospitality brand might find it outperforms peers on *Joyful* experiences but lags on *Dependable* service, prompting exploration and investment in operations. A bank might discover it has a 'superpower' with its customers uniquely valuing *Respectful* and doubles down on a corresponding brand identity and offers.</Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>
