## Apex + NielsenIQ

NielsenIQ (NIQ) panel data offers detailed visibility into what people are buying, when, and how often at the household level. Apex enhances this data by explaining *why* those choices are made and what to do to influence future behavior. By adding motivational context to behavioral patterns, we transform NIQ's depth into strategic foresight.

### From Descriptive to Predictive

NIQ panel data is exceptional at answering *what happened*. Apex adds the motivational layer that helps teams understand *why it happened* and *what to do next*. This makes panel insights prescriptive, not just descriptive.

For instance, panel data might reveal a dip in purchases of a specific category among lapsed households. With Apex, we uncover whether those lapses stem from low <Motivator name="predictable" /> value (e.g., product availability issues), unmet <Motivator name="meaningful" /> needs (e.g., shifting brand values), or diminished <Motivator name="joyful" /> experiences (e.g., uninspiring in-store engagement).

### Example: Household Panel Decline in Premium Snack Category

A CPG brand notices through NIQ panels that households once loyal to its premium snack brand are purchasing less frequently.

**With NIQ alone:**  
The data shows the decline but not the reason or what to change.

**With Apex overlay:**  
Motivational modeling reveals:

- <Motivator name="authentic" /> is declining. Customers feel the brand is losing its original purpose.
- <Motivator name="distinct" /> is weakening. Competitors are mimicking the packaging and messaging.
- <Motivator name="joyful" /> moments in usage occasions are being underleveraged.

**Prescriptive Actions:**

- Refresh brand positioning to reclaim authenticity.
- Reintroduce legacy messaging and founder storytelling.
- Launch experiential campaigns to reintroduce “treat yourself” moments.

**Business Impact:**

- Stabilized loyalty rates  
- Uplift in repeat purchase among previously lapsed segments  
- Stronger brand equity retention in competitive category

### How the Integration Works

- **Motivational Overlay:** Apex applies a tailored motivational survey to the same panel demographics or builds synthetic models aligned to purchasing cohorts.
- **Joint Modeling:** NIQ panel data is segmented and scored based on motivational resonance identifying which motivations are weakening or rising by product, cohort, or region.
- **Prescriptive Output:** We deliver actionable insight decks and simulation models that show which interventions are most likely to win back or deepen loyalty in target panels.
- **Continuous Tracking:** Apex models can be updated regularly or aligned with campaign cycles, allowing you to keep pace with shifts in shopper sentiment.

### Why It Matters

Panel data explains what's happening in the market. Apex makes it actionable by surfacing the motivations you can influence. By identifying gaps between what your shoppers *do* and what they *feel*, you gain a decision-ready edge. Motivations like <Motivator name="authentic" />, <Motivator name="distinct" />, and <Motivator name="joyful" /> become tools not just traits.

Apex enhances NIQ's panel data and equips brands with confident interventions that resonate with real human drivers creating desire.
