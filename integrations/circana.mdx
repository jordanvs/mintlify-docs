## Apex + Circana

Circana sets the standard in understanding retail performance delivering best-in-class data on sales trends, category dynamics, shopper behavior, and competitive share. Apex builds on this foundation by adding motivational intelligence that explains *why* shoppers behave the way they do and *how* to influence their future decisions.

With both Apex and Circana in your corner, you are empowered to take reporting and reaction into proactive strategy rooted in real behavior and the sentiment behind it.

### New Visibility and Influence

Circana gives clients unparalleled visibility into what's happening across retail and shopper ecosystems. Apex complements that with insight into why it's happening and what to do next. 

[Motivations](/motivations/overview) like <Motivator name="authentic" />, <Motivator name="distinct" />, and <Motivator name="meaningful" />, for example, help interpret sales shifts, segment behaviors, and campaign outcomes in a way that makes action clear and ROI more predictable.

With Apex and Circana both in your toolset, you get three core categories of value: 

1. **Enhanced Segmentation**, where motivational overlays turn Circana's demographic and behavioral segments into actionable personas; 
2. **Prescriptive Strategy Modeling**, where Apex uses Circana's market truths as inputs for simulations that predict which interventions are most likely to succeed; and 
3. **Ongoing Optimization**, where motivational data is refreshed in tandem with Circana's tracking cycles to ensure that strategies remain aligned with evolving consumer priorities. 

### Example: Enhancing Category Growth Strategy

A leading personal care brand sees Circana data highlighting growth in natural products and a rise in millennial and Gen Z purchase frequency. Circana provides granular visibility into where growth is coming from, what price points are moving, and how competitors are positioning.

**With Apex added:**

- Motivational profiling reveals that shoppers driving this trend are high in <Motivator name="principled" /> and <Motivator name="joyful" />. They want brands that reflect their ethics and feel energizing in everyday use.
- Segment-level analysis shows that while multiple brands are competing on function and value, few are tapping into emotional or identity-driven motivations.

**Combined Strategy with Circana + Apex:**

- Apex enriches Circana's segment and share data with motivational personas.
- The most responsive cohorts are identified and simulated to determine which campaign or product strategies will resonate most.
- The brand tailors its retail execution, messaging, and innovation roadmap based on insights grounded in both observed and motivated behavior.

**Outcome:**

- Faster activation of Circana-identified growth opportunities  
- Higher resonance of new product launches and retail campaigns  
- Increased confidence in which messages and features will influence next-quarter performance

### How the Integration Works

- **Segment Enrichment:** Apex motivational profiles are mapped to Circana-defined shopper or occasion segments, enabling deeper understanding and action planning.
- **Co-Developed Insights:** Circana's empirical market truths are combined with Apex's behavioral-science-trained motivational layer to create an even deeper picture of the market.
- **Predictive Action Planning:** Intervention strategies are built and simulated, grounded in both sales reality and sentimental resonance.
